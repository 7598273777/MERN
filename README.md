TASK 1 - CLASS 1 (16/02/2024) -  ( Introduction to Browser & web )

Here i have attached my Medium Blog POST RELATED TO TASKS 

1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
   The transition from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 represents a significant leap in web protocol technology. HTTP/2's improvements in connection handling, header compression, binary protocol, server push, and prioritization result in a faster, more efficient web experience. As web developers and businesses continue to embrace these advancements, users can expect a more responsive and seamless online experience.
The way websites fetch and display content significantly impacts user experience, search engine ranking, and overall satisfaction. This is where HTTP protocols come into play, acting as the language web browsers and servers use to communicate

2 . Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
    In JavaScript, objects are one of the most important data types, used to store collections of data and more complex entities. Internally is crucial for working effectively with JavaScript

3. Read about IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address

IP Address
An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network, such as the internet. It acts as a virtual address that allows devices to communicate and identify each other on the network. There are two main versions of IP addresses:
•	IPv4: The older version, consisting of four sets of numbers between 0 and 255, separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
•	IPv6: The newer version, with a more complex format using hexadecimal numbers and colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

Port
A port is a virtual communication channel associated with an IP address. It allows different applications or services running on the same device to receive and send data independently. Imagine an IP address as a building with multiple doors (ports), each leading to a specific apartment (application or service). Common port numbers include:
•	80: HTTP (web traffic)
•	443: HTTPS (secure HTTP)
•	21: FTP (file transfer)
•	25: SMTP (email)

HTTP Methods
HTTP methods are specific commands sent within an HTTP request to instruct the server on how to handle the request. These methods define the desired action on the server-side, such as retrieving data, creating new resources, or updating existing ones. Some common HTTP methods include:
•	GET: Retrieves data from the server, often used for fetching web pages or resources.
•	POST: Submits data to the server, typically used for submitting forms or creating new data.
•	PUT: Updates existing data on the server.
•	DELETE: Removes data from the server.
•	PATCH: Applies partial modifications to data on the server.

MAC Address
A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique hardware identifier assigned to each network interface card (NIC) in a device. It's used at the data link layer of the OSI model to ensure proper delivery of data frames within a local network segment. Unlike IP addresses, which can be dynamic and change, MAC addresses are typically burned into the hardware and remain static.
Relationships between these concepts:
•	IP address and port: Together, they uniquely identify a specific application or service running on a device on the network.
•	IP address and MAC address: An IP address is assigned to a logical network interface, while a MAC address is assigned to the physical NIC hardware. A device can have multiple MAC addresses but only one primary IP address for each network interface.
•	HTTP methods and ports: Specific HTTP methods are often associated with specific ports. For example, GET and POST requests for web pages typically use port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).
